Please click on the publication link on the start page.<br/>
First you are requested to choose a document type. Right beneath that you can upload your document files. Having done
so you may click on "send". What follows now is the actual form.
You have to fill in data about your publication here (so called metadata), which is used to describe your work in
cataloges and other bibliographic
directories. Describe the document you want to upload using the categories and fields on the publication form.
Depending on the document type, some of
these fields are <span class="required">mandatory</span> and therefore have to be filled in. Please describe your
document as clear as possible.

Mandatory fields are for example:<br/>

<ul>
  <li>the document type (must be choosen from a list)</li>
  <li>the title of your publication and the language of the title</li>
  <li>the abstract of the document</li>
  <li>the publication date of your document (normally the day you publish it online)</li>
  <li>the language of the document (must be choosen from a list)</li>
  <li>the licence, under which you want to publish your document (must be choosen from a list)</li>
</ul>

If you are unsure what to fill in certain form fields, you can point the cursor on a field and an explaining help text will be shown.<br/>
After you have finished the form, all data will be displayed once again for a check-up and you then have three possibilities: you can correct them if necessary, add your document to a
collection or simply safe it directly.<br /><br/>
