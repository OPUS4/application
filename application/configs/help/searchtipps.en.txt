<h4>Boolean Operators <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b>, <b>NOT</b></h4>

<p>When you use the <b>Simple Search</b>, all terms are combined by <b>AND</b> automatically. For a more tightly
focused search you may use the Boolean Operators to combine different search terms.</p>

<p><b>AND:</b> The document has to contain all search terms.</p>

<p><b>OR:</b> The document has to contain one of the search terms. This function broadens your search and is
recommended, when there are different terms for the same meaning.</p>

<div><code>article <b>OR</b> paper</code></div>

<p><b>NOT:</b> This function works excluding and might be useful to reduce a large result list: Documents, which
contain the one term, may not contain the other.</p>

<div><code>article <b>NOT</b> paper</code></div>

<p>The Boolean Operators work for the <b>Advanced Search</b> as well. You may use them to combine different search
terms within one search field. For example, to search for documents of the author "Doe" in the years 2002 or 2003,
use the query:</p>

<code>Author: Doe <br /> Year: 2002 <b>OR</b> 2003</code>

<h4>Wildcards</h4>

<p>In the field 'Search:', you may use the symbols '*' and '?' as wildcards. Use them in place of a character or
characters that are unknown or that may differ. You cannot use them in front of a word or search string.</p>

<code>Example 1: <b>chemi*</b> finds <i>chemical</i> but also <i>chemistry</i> or <i>chemist</i>.</code>

<code>Example 2: <b>licen?e</b> finds <i>licence</i> and <i>license</i>.</code>

<p>You may use double quotes (") to search for phrases.</p>
