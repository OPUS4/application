How to modify the complex type "field":
=======================================
The complex type "field" may contain the attributes languageoption, mandatory, multiplicity
and name. It needs at least the attribute "name". If there is no other entry, the attributes
languageoption, mandatory and multiplicity use their default values.

- Mandatory attributes accept only the values "yes" or "no". The default value is "no".

- Multiplicity attributes accept only integers for quantities, or the asterisk "*" to represent
unlimited quantity. The default value is "1".

- The attribute "name" has only lowercase characters and digits. It always starts with
characters. Words can be separated by the underscore character "_". There is no default
value for "name". It must be declared.
