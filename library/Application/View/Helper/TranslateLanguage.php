     * The default value for $messageid is changed to distinguish between null values and no
     * parameter at all. This way translate() can still be used to obtain the translation object,
     * which is the default behavior.
     *
     * Also makes sure, that first option is never interpreted as a locale. This avoids the problem
     * of a placeholder value that matches a locale, for instance a collection with the name 'de'.
