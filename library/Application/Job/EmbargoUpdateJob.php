 * This cron job must be used if embargo dates are used in repository.
 *
 * This script finds documents with expired embargo date that have to been
 * updated after the expiration (ServerDateModified < EmbargoDate) and sets
 * ServerDateModified to the current time.
 *
 * The expiration of an embargo date does not change the document. Until the
 * date is expired access to the files of the document is blocked. After the
 * expiration access to the files is possible. However the document will not
 * be harvested again automatically. In order for the document to be included
 * in the next harvesting ServerDateModified needs to be updated.
