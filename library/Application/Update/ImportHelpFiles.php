/**
 * Imports help files into database.
 *
 * Starting with OPUS 4.7 the content of the FAQ page is stored in TMX files.
 * Customizations are stored in the database.
 * The TXT files in 'application/configs/help' are no longer used.
 * The help.ini file is still used to determine the structure of the FAQ page.
 *
 * In a clean instance basically nothing needs to happen because the keys and
 * the content are already defined in TMX files in the 'help' module.
 *
 * For customized instances the content of the TXT files needs to be stored in
 * the corresponding keys.
 *
 * Before 4.7 the key 'help_content_searchtipps' translated into the names of
 * the files actually containing the content. Starting with 4.7 the key directly
 * translates into the content.
 *
 * During the update process the corresponding files have to be identified by
 * parsing 'help.ini' and translating the keys into the names of the files.
 * Then the files have to be read and the content stored in the keys that so far
 * contained the filenames.
 *
 * If a key does not contain a file name it is ignored.
 *
 * If the content matches the default TMX entries in the help module it is not
 * stored in the database.
 *
 * The 'imprint' and 'contact' files are ignored, because they are imported in a
 * separate earlier step. The content of the files is handled differently because
 * there are separate pages for imprint and contact and their content is only
 * optionally included on the FAQ page. (It makes sense from a user perspective,
 * but it is a special case that needs to be handled in various places.)
 *
 * TODO eliminate overlap with Application_update_ImportStaticPages
