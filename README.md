This fork of the OPUS 4 application Git repository contains the layout and modifications for the OPUS 4 Matheon repository hosted at KOBV.

NOTE: Although the main different to a regular OPUS 4 installation is the layout for Matheon, this is a full fork of the OPUS 4 application. As development progresses it might be possible to create OPUS 4 layout modules that can be added to any OPUS 4 installation using Composer.
