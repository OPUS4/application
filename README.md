This fork of the OPUS 4 application Git repository contains the layout 
and modifications for the OPUS 4 Matheon repository hosted at KOBV.

OPUS 4 Matheon Repository

## OPUS 4 at GitHub

NOTE: Although the main difference to a regular OPUS 4 installation is 
the layout for Matheon, this is a full fork of the OPUS 4 application. 
As development progresses it might be possible to create OPUS 4 layout 
modules that can be added to any OPUS 4 installation using Composer.
